Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
-	Language used to specify the presentation aspects (e.g. layout and formatting) of structurally marked up documents.
-	Developed by Hakom Wium Lie (CHSS) and Bert Bos (SSP)
-	Versions: 
o	CSS 1 (December 1996)
o	CSS 2.1 (June 2011)
o	CSS 3
-	CSS Preprocessors, CSS Framework
o	Sass, Less, 960 Grid System, Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize, etc.
HTML/XHTML Stylesheet
-	Author styles
o	External stylesheet (recommended)
	Uses the link element
(ref, type, href, media, title)
	Alternate stylesheet supported in firefox

o	Embedded Styles
	Responsve design
	For quick prototyping
o	Inline styles
-	User agent styles (example default CSS 2.1 stylesheets for HTML 4)
CSS Statements
-	At - Rules
@charset
@import
@media
@font-face (define and download webfonts)
@keyframes (keyframe animation)
@page
-	CSS Rule Set (aka CSS Rules, Style Rules)
o	Consist of a selector, followed by a brace-enclosed declaration block
e.g. *body is a selector
		body {
display: none;
color: blue
}
CSS Selectors
-	Selector
o	Structure used as a condition in a CSS rule to determine which elements in the documentation tree are matched by the selector and are thus targeted by the formatting specified in the CSS rule declaration block.
o	The matched elements are called the subjects of the selector
-	Selector syntax
o	Chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one pseudo-element possibly appended to the last sequence.
Example: div #abc > p.xyz [title] + span: first_child::after
>, + = contributor
After = pseudo-element
Span:first_child::after = pseudo-class
o	Sequence of simple selectors
	Chain of simple selectors not separated by combinators
	Always starts with a type sector or a universal selector
	Cannot contain other type selectors or universal selectors
o	Group of selectors
	Coma- separated list of selectors representing the union of all elements
e.g. h1, h2, h3
-	Simple selectors
o	Type selector (p, div, span)
o	Universal selector (*)
o	Attribute selector
	[attr]
	[attr=value]
	[attr~=value] (class attribute)
	[attr |= value] (language attribute)
	[attr^=value] (start CSS3)
	[attr$=value] (end CSS3)
	[attr*=value] (anywhere in between CSS3)
o	Class selector (<p class=”xyz”>)
o	ID selector (<div id=”abc”> *for ID attribute)
o	pseudo-selector
	Dynamic pseudo-class
	link pseudo-classes
: link
: visited
	user action pseudo-classes
	: hover
	: active
	: focus
	target pseudo-class
	: target (CSS3)
	language pseudo-class
	: lang()
	UI element states pseudo-class
	: enabled (CSS3)
	: disabled (CSS3)
	: checked (CSS3)
	: indeterminate (CSS3)
	structural pseudo-class
	: root
	: first-child
	: last-child
	: only-child
	: nth-child()
	: nth-last-child
	: first-of-type
	: last-of-type
	: only-of-type
	: nth-of-type()
	: nth-last-of-type()
: empty
*all CSS3 except first-child
	negation
	:not (CSS3)
o	combinators
	descendant combinator (whitespace ie space, tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed)
	child combinator (>)
	sibling combinators
		adjacent sibling combinator (+)
		general sibling combinator (~) CSS3
o	pseudo-elements
	:: first-letter	, : first-letter
	:: first-line	, : first-line
	:: before	, : before
	:: after		, : after



CSS Rule Precedence
>by origin and importance
//ADDED
-Resource: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html
Style sheets may have three different origins: author, user, and user agent.
	Author. The author specifies style sheets for a source document according to the conventions of the document language. For instance, in HTML, style sheets may be included in the document or linked externally.
	User: The user may be able to specify style information for a particular document. For example, the user may specify a file that contains a style sheet or the user agent may provide an interface that generates a user style sheet (or behaves as if it did).
	User agent: Conforming user agents must apply a default style sheet (or behave as if they did). A user agent's default style sheet should present the elements of the document language in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations for the document language (e.g., for visual browsers, the EM element in HTML is presented using an italic font). Style sheets from these three origins will overlap in scope, and they interact according to the cascade.
	
	Sort according to importance (normal or important) and origin (author, user, or user agent). In ascending order of precedence:
o	user agent important declarations
o	user important declarations
o	author important declarations
o	author normal declarations
o	user normal declarations
o	user agent normal declarations
	by specificity
o	inline style
o	number of ID selectors
o	number of class selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes
o	number of type selectors and pseudo-elements
	by order
JAVASCRIPT SRC= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
	<scrip type=’text/javascript’ scr=script.js>
SRFC= https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp
The <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
Internal Script:
External Script:
There are several ways an external script can be executed:
•	If async="async": The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing)
•	If async is not present and defer="defer": The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
•	If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page
