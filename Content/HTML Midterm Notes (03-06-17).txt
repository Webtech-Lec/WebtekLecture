CSS Statements
- At-Rules
	@charset
	@import
	@media
	@font-face (define and download webfonts)
	@keyframes (keyframe animation)
	@page
- CSS Rule Sets (aka CSS Rules, Style Rules)
	consists of a selector, followed by a brace-enclosed declaration block ______
	e.g.  *body is the selector
		body {
		  display: none;
		  color: blue;
		}

CSS Selectors
- selector
	> structure used as a condition in a CSS rule to determine which elements in the document tree are matched by the selector and are thus targeted by the formatting specified in the CSS rule declaration block
	> the matched elements are called the subjects of the selector ___
- selector syntax
	> chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one pseudo-element possibly appended to the last sequence
	     example: div #abc > p.xyz[title] + span:first_child::after
		>, + = contributor
		after = pseudo-element
		span:first_child::after = pseudo-class
	> sequence of simple selectors
		- chain of simple selectors not separated by combinators
		- always starts with a type selector or a universal selector
		- cannot contain other type selectors or universal selectors
	> group of selectors
		- comma - separated list of selectors representing the union of all elements selected by each of the selectors in the list
		e.g. h1, h2, h3
- simple selectors
	> type selector (p, div, span)
	> universal selector (*)
	> attribute selector
		[attr]
		[attr=value]
		[attr~=value] (class attribute)
		[attr|=value] (language attribute)
		[attr^=value] (start CSS3)
		[attr$=value] (end CSS3)
		[attr*=value] (anywhere in between CSS3)
	> class selector (<p class="xyz">)
	> ID selector (<div id="abc"> *for ID attribute)
	> pseudo-selector
		- dynamic psuedo-class
		   link pseudo-classes
			:link
			:visited
		   user action pseudo-classes
			:hover
			:active
			:focus
		- target pseudo-class
			:target (CSS3)
		- language pseudo-class
			:lang()
		- UI element states psedo-class

		- negation
			:not (CSS3)
	> combinators
		- descendant combinator (whitespace ie space, tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed)
		- child combinator (>)

		::first-letter	, :first-letter
		::first-line	, :first-line
		::before	, :before

		author normal declarations
		user normal declarations
		user agent normal declarations
	> by specificity
		inline style
		number of ID selectors
		number of class selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes
		number of type selectors and pseudo-elements
	> by order
